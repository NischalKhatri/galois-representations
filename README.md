# Galois Representations Associated to Modular Forms

## Overview

This research focuses on verifying Shimura’s Theorem, specifically for a modular curve denoted as Γ_0(35). Modular curves are complex structures that arise from specific transformations and have deep implications in number theory.

## Key Concepts

- **Modular Curves:** Curves derived from the complex upper half-plane using specific groups of transformations.
- **Modular Forms:** Special functions on modular curves with significant applications in mathematics.
- **Shimura’s Theorem:** This theorem connects modular forms to algebraic structures known as Jacobians. This project aims to verify the theorem through explicit calculations.

## Project Goals

1. **Model Construction:** Create an explicit model for the modular curve Γ_0(35).
2. **Differential Matching:** Match specific differential forms to the corresponding modular forms.
3. **Elliptic Curve Equation:** Derive an equation for an elliptic curve that corresponds to one of the modular forms.
4. **Verification:** Use computational methods to verify the accuracy of Shimura’s Theorem for the constructed model.

## Methods and Results

- **Model Construction:** Using eta-functions, an explicit model for Γ_0(35) was derived.
- **Matching Differentials:** By comparing q-expansions, the differentials were matched to the modular forms.
- **Elliptic Curve:** An equation for an elliptic curve was derived, transforming it into standard Weierstrass form.
- **Verification:** Using Galois automorphisms and Frobenius automorphisms, the theorem was verified for specific primes.

## Conclusion

This research successfully verified Shimura’s Theorem for the modular curve Γ_0(35) through explicit computation and algebraic methods. Further work involves similar verification for more complex modular forms.
